To Add:
    Find something to map <BS> to.

To Fix:
    Add function to remove the current element from the quickfix list
        Need to know how to find what quickfix element I'm currently on
    Pymode folding sometimes just goes away -- figure out why and when.
    Neomake errors -- figure out and fix.
    Syntax highlighting after argdo on first command.
    Lawrencium error message at end or start (not sure which)
    Submode doesn't work with no file
    Remove all colorschemes I don't use
        currently use:
            molokai
            apprentice
            hybrid
            techras
            autumn
            pylight
        Search for others I like
    Possibly remove the SetColors script

Repo organisation:
    Find a nice method to update the colorschemes.
    Keep a list of all changed/added keybord shortcuts.

Possible extras:
    Lisp ftplugin - map C-e and C-y to "move in sexp" up and down respectively.

Plugins possibly to remove:
    python-mode - cannabalise the motion commands and create a compile file for pylint2
        What I use:
            Motion commands --> see what I have in patches
            Folding         --> autoload/pymode/folding.vim
                                Maybe modify this a bit to take account of closures
            Lint            --> Make a compiler file for pylint2 and python2-pep8


Keys that are valid mappings (i.e. don't directly overwrite anything):
     z .. {p,q,u,y,B,I,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,Y,Z}
     Z .. [^ZQ]
     [ .. something
     ] .. something
     c .. something
     d .. something
     y .. something
     g .. something
     \ .. something

Keys I don't use:
    spelling mappings (actually, just very rarely use them)
    Q
    gQ
    ZQ
    ZZ
    S




Neovim:

Bothers -- 
    C-w c  and  :close
        Don't take a count any more

    Error messasge with loadview compared to vim -- has different options, so makes
    sense that the options don't match.
    Also causes errors which stop :Gdiff from working.


Things to add
    Use the Alt keys for useful things everywhere (yay for LeoNerds' libtermkey)
