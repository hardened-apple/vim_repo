To Add:
    Find something to map <BS> to.

To Fix:
    When recording macros and the keymap option is set, running the macro
        ignores the keymap option.
    Pymode folding sometimes just goes away -- figure out why and when.
    Neomake errors -- figure out and fix.
    Syntax highlighting after argdo on first command.
    vsh filetype CommandRange function includes last line if the last line is
        an empty prompt and there is no text between the current line and it.
    Neovim ':Man' opens in a new tab
    Neovim airline statusline when split windows extends into other window
        shows a function name including syntastic
    Have a look at syntax checking capabilities of Neomake -- can it replace Syntastic?
    Lawrencium error message at end or start (not sure which)
    Submode doesn't work with no file
    Remove all colorschemes I don't use
        currently use:
            molokai
            apprentice
            hybrid
            techras
            autumn
            pylight
        Search for others I like
    Possibly remove the SetColors script

Repo organisation:
    Find a nice method to update the colorschemes.
    Keep a list of all changed/added keybord shortcuts.

Possible extras:
    Lisp ftplugin - map C-e and C-y to "move in sexp" up and down respectively.

Plugins possibly to remove:
    python-mode - cannabalise the motion commands and create a compile file for pylint2
        What I use:
            Motion commands --> see what I have in patches
            Folding         --> autoload/pymode/folding.vim
                                Maybe modify this a bit to take account of closures
            Lint            --> Make a compiler file for pylint2 and python2-pep8


Keys that are valid mappings (i.e. don't directly overwrite anything):
     z .. {p,q,u,y,B,I,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,Y,Z}
     Z .. [^ZQ]
     [ .. something
     ] .. something
     c .. something
     d .. something
     y .. something
     g .. something
     \ .. something

Keys I don't use:
    spelling mappings (actually, just very rarely use them)
    Q
    gQ
    ZQ
    ZZ
    S




Neovim:

Bothers --
    Error messasge with loadview compared to vim -- has different options, so makes
    sense that the options don't match.
    Also causes errors which stop :Gdiff from working.


Things to add
    Use the Alt keys for useful things everywhere (yay for LeoNerds' libtermkey)
