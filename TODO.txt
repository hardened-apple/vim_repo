To Add:
    Find something to map <BS> to.
    Set colours for the sneak plugin in my techras colourscheme.
    Find sensible setting for find path that includes current directory and all below.
        i.e. I want a method to add recursive search to a depth of 2 directories.

To Fix:
    My OpenManThisWindow function closes the current window if the man page
        isn't found - add some kind of error check.

Repo organisation:
    Find a nice method to update the colorschemes.
    Keep a list of all changed/added keybord shortcuts.

Possible extras:
    Lisp ftplugin - map C-e and C-y to "move in sexp" up and down respectively.

Plugins possibly to remove:
    python-mode - cannabalise the motion commands and create a compile file for pylint2
        What I use:
            Motion commands --> see what I have in patches
            Folding         --> autoload/pymode/folding.vim
                                Maybe modify this a bit to take account of closures
            Lint            --> Make a compiler file for pylint2 and python2-pep8


Keys that are valid mappings (i.e. don't directly overwrite anything):
     z .. {p,q,u,y,B,I,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,Y,Z}
     Z .. [^ZQ]
     [ .. something
     ] .. something
     c .. something
     d .. something
     y .. something
     g .. something
     \ .. something

Keys I don't use:
    spelling mappings (actually, just very rarely use them)
    Q
    gQ
    ZQ
    ZZ
    S
