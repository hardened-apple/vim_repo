Repo organisation:
     Find a nice method to update the colorschemes.

Things to read:
    vi introduction on internet (firefox bookmark) [waz]

Possible extras:
    Lisp ftplugin - map C-e and C-y to "move in sexp" up and down respectively.
    Funkey - regexp parsing for functions, puts results in Ctrl-P
        https://github.com/tacahiroy/ctrlp-funky

Possible changes:
    Put maplocalleader to \ and leave mapleader as <SPC>
        More mappings available, but harder to reach.
    <left> <right> <up> <down> window swap, shifted versions window resize

Plugins possibly to remove:
    python-mode - cannabalise the motion commands and create a compile file for pylint
        What I use:
            Motion commands --> see what I have in patches
            Folding         --> autoload/pymode/folding.vim
                                Maybe modify this a bit to take account of closures
            Lint            --> Make a compiler file for pylint2 and python2-pep8


Keys that are valid mappings (i.e. don't directly overwrite anything):
     z .. {p,q,u,y,B,I,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,Y,Z}
     Z .. [^ZQ]
     [ .. something
     ] .. something
     c .. something
     d .. something
     y .. something
     g .. something
     \ .. something

Keys I don't use:
    spelling mappings (actually, just very rarely use them)
    Q
    gQ
    ZQ
    ZZ
    S
