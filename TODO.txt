To Add:
    Find something to map <BS> to.
    Allow navigation (and opening folds) via mouse
        Have a look at what 'acme' does, and what 'vim' already does.

To Fix:
    When using sneak-stream in C files, the folds close after selection.
        This basically means it doesn't save keystrokes, because I have to
        expand the fold immediately after moving.
    When recording macros and the keymap option is set, running the macro
        ignores the keymap option.
    Pymode folding sometimes just goes away -- figure out why and when.
    Neomake errors -- figure out and fix.
    Syntax highlighting after argdo on first command.
    vsh filetype CommandRange function includes last line if the last line is
        an empty prompt and there is no text between the current line and it.
    Neovim doesn't accept my <LeftRelease> mapping.
    Neovim ':Man' opens in a new tab
    Neovim airline statusline when split windows extends into other window
        shows a function name including syntastic
    Have a look at syntax checking capabilities of Neomake -- can it replace Syntastic?
    Lawrencium error message at end or start (not sure which)
    Submode doesn't work with no file
    Remove all colorschemes I don't use
        currently use:
            molokai
            apprentice
            hybrid
            techras
            autumn
            pylight
        Search for others I like
    Possibly remove the SetColors script
    Sneak has some problems with the keymap option
        Shifted keymap

        1) Complains not found rather than just inserting at point
        2) When using '.' on a cu<position> command, sneak gets into an infinite loop.
        3) Only when using *change*, not just any operator.
        4) Requires tpope/repeat to also be active.

        Also
        1) Would be nice to not ignore the keymap when repeating a macro -- more of a
            general vim problem than anything else.

        2) Why is vim interruptable with Ctrl-C, while neovim is not.

Repo organisation:
    Find a nice method to update the colorschemes.
    Keep a list of all changed/added keybord shortcuts.

Possible extras:
    Lisp ftplugin - map C-e and C-y to "move in sexp" up and down respectively.

Plugins possibly to remove:
    python-mode - cannabalise the motion commands and create a compile file for pylint2
        What I use:
            Motion commands --> see what I have in patches
            Folding         --> autoload/pymode/folding.vim
                                Maybe modify this a bit to take account of closures
            Lint            --> Make a compiler file for pylint2 and python2-pep8


Keys that are valid mappings (i.e. don't directly overwrite anything):
     z .. {p,q,u,y,B,I,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,Y,Z}
     Z .. [^ZQ]
     [ .. something
     ] .. something
     c .. something
     d .. something
     y .. something
     g .. something
     \ .. something

Keys I don't use:
    spelling mappings (actually, just very rarely use them)
    Q
    gQ
    ZQ
    ZZ
    S




Neovim:

Bothers --
    Error messasge with loadview compared to vim -- has different options, so makes
    sense that the options don't match.
    Also causes errors which stop :Gdiff from working.


Things to add
    Use the Alt keys for useful things everywhere (yay for LeoNerds' libtermkey)
