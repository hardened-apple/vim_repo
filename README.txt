My vim dir so that I can easily get my working environment wherever I roam.

Everything interesting comes from somewhere else - google 'vim <dir>' for any dir in the bundle directory.
Pathogen.vim is indispensible for making sense without a package manager.

As Arch has python3 under python by default (and similar for pylint, pep8 etc), syntastic will check python3 scripts.
As python-mode comes with it's own syntax checker (which is for python2), pymode will check python2 scripts.
